### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 overall I liked this lab because it introduced us to the basics of the 
    course. It showed us what we would be using in the future and how to use them 
    properly. This was also the first actual lab where we had to code a small 
    program and do all of the edit-compile-run cycle.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 I liked this lab because it was one of the first labs where we 
    used different operators. Using the division operators and calling functions 
    from a different file was a good start to learning how to call functions and 
    use different files together. This was a good start and the basics of 
    learning in future labs.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 I liked this lab because it was one of the harder labs that we 
    have done through the semester but it was also doable. Using vector mutators 
    and using fstream was a big challenge to overcome but ultimately it was fun. 
    Seeing the use of the fstream includes was cool to see understand from a 
    first hand experience.
